# Angular vs. React

This repo contains materials for my Systems Design course project, including the final presentation slides and example code.

## Examples

Each example demonstrates manipulating the contents of an `h1` element via a select box and input field. You can run the examples by calling `npm run-script X` and visiting `http://localhost:8080/`, where `X` is one of:

- `ex-pure-js`: A pure JavaScript implementation
- `ex-angular`: Using Angular
- `ex-react`: Using React
