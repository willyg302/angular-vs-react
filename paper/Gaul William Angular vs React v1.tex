	The modern web is inherently dynamic. As the Internet has evolved -- as JavaScript plays an increasingly ubiquitous role and applications grow in size and complexity -- developers have turned ever more toward web frameworks to make sense of the chaos. Many companies now favor applicants who have experience working with these frameworks, and so a good understanding of their usage and purpose is crucial. Why do they exist? What problems do they purport to solve, if any? How will they benefit developers and end users alike? This project aims to answer these questions by examining two very popular web frameworks in more detail: Angular and React.

The web then was, as many might now say, boring.

\section{Hello Dynamic World}

	\emph{In which the author uses a simple dynamic web page to investigate the designs of Angular and React.}
\end{quote}

To gain a better understanding of how frameworks improve upon pure JavaScript, it is necessary to consider a simple example -- in this case, the web page shown in Figure \ref{fig:Example}.

\begin{SCfigure}[][h]
	\centering
	\caption{A simple example of a dynamic web element: the header text changes based on user input. Code for this example in pure JavaScript, as well as using the Angular and React frameworks, can be found in Appendix \ref{app:code}.}
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{hello-world.png}}
	\label{fig:Example}
\end{SCfigure}

Syncing the contents of an \texttt{<h1>} element to an input is fairly straightforward with pure JavaScript: attach an \emph{event listener} to the input, and update the header's \texttt{innerHTML} accordingly whenever an event is fired. The problem with this approach is that it does not scale well. Imagine having to handle the updates of several thousand UI elements, a typical number for a web application as complex as Facebook. This pattern would have to be duplicated thousands of times, and the codebase would quickly become unmanageable.

In contrast, the Angular code contains no such low-level event handling. Rather, a JavaScript variable is introduced into the application's scope and bound to both the input and header \footnote{The variable, \texttt{\$scope.subject}, is specified as the input's \emph{model} via the \texttt{ng-model} attribute and the header's content via an inline template.}. This concept is known as \emph{two-way data binding} because updates may flow in both directions; when a user modifies the input its underlying model (the variable) is updated, and similarly when the variable is modified via JavaScript its new value will be reflected in the UI \cite{Angular:Docs}. The resulting code is highly declarative in nature, and moreover very terse, as nearly all of the low-level logic is handled by Angular behind the scenes.

React takes a different tack by removing HTML from the picture entirely. In its place are React components that encapsulate state and business logic, and that may be nested to construct complex applications. Updates are handled by describing the UI as it should appear at any discrete moment in time within the \texttt{render/0} function -- whenever the state of a component changes, it is automatically ``re-rendered'' \footnote{Here the markup for the input depends upon \texttt{this.state.subject}. Whenever the input is changed, \texttt{this.setState/1} is triggered with the new value, and the UI is rendered again.}. Because events from the user must still be handled manually, this is known as \emph{one-way data binding} \cite{Hunt:2014}.




One-way versus two-way data binding may seem like a simple distinction, but it has profound implications for how an application is designed, developed, and even reasoned about.


% On the one hand, Angular offers an expressive extension of HTML specifically designed for dynamic views, centered on a concept called “two-way data binding.”

% On the other hand, React uses a component system that makes it easy to reason about application architecture, powered by “one-way data binding.”

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{quote}
	\singlespacing
	\emph{In which the points are tallied and a champion is crowned.}
\end{quote}



%It is hoped that this project will inspire any budding web developers in the class to embrace web frameworks and the design principles that they afford. Moreover, as graduation approaches, studying this subject should be good preparation for entering the web development industry.
